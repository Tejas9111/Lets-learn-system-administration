The concept of Linux File permission and ownership is crucial in Linux. Here is the explaination of Linux file permissions and ownership.



1.	Ownership: 
Every file and directory on your Unix/Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner, given below.

 

-	User: A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. 

                   Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.

 

-	Group: A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same 

                   Linux group permissions access to the file.

 

-	Other: Any other user who has access to a file. This person has neither created the file, 

                   Nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file. 



2.	Permissions: 

Every file and directory in your UNIX/Linux system has following 3 permissions defined for all the 3 owners discussed above.

              

-	Read (4): This permission give you the authority to open and read a file. Read permission on a directory gives you the ability 

                    To lists its content.

                    

-	Write (2): The write permission gives you the authority to modify the contents of a file. The write permission on a directory 

                    Gives you the authority to add, remove and rename files stored in the directory.

                    

-	Execute (1): In Unix/Linux, you cannot run a program unless the execute permission is set. If the execute permission is not set, 

                   You might still be able to see/modify the program code(provided read & write permissions are set), but not run it. 

                   

Setting Permissions:

-	To change permissions of a file or directory , run a command

                      $ chmod [permission_code] filename

                      

                      Permission-code:

                      4 – read permission

                      2 – write permission

                      1 – execure permission

R       Permission to read the file.

W       Permission to write (or delete) the file.

X       Permission to execute the file, or, in

        The case of a directory, search it.

                      

                      Ex: $ chmod 755 file.txt 

                            Now file.txt has following permissions:

                              1. User: rwxread / write / execute permissions (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)

                              2. Group: r-x read / execute permissions (4 + 1 = 5)

                              3. Others: r-x read / execute permissions (4 + 1 = 5)

                              

-	To change the owner of the file, run following command:

                        $ chown username: groupname file.txt

      -It is the command and system call used to change the access permissions of file system objects (files and directories) called as chmode.
